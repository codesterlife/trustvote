# üó≥Ô∏è TrustVote ‚Äî Product Requirements Document (PRD) (Blockchain-Enhanced Version)

## üìå Project Overview
**TrustVote** is a decentralized electronic voting system built using Vue.js (frontend), Django (backend), and a blockchain-based smart contract system on Ethereum. It ensures end-to-end integrity of voting through verifiable, tamper-proof smart contract logic, leveraging MetaMask, Web3.js, and Solidity contracts for secure, transparent elections.

---

## üéØ Goals & Objectives
- Ensure **trustless voting** using blockchain and smart contracts.
- Securely identify and whitelist eligible voters.
- Prevent multiple votes and manipulation through on-chain enforcement.
- Allow admins to manage elections through a hybrid (Django + Ethereum) backend.
- Provide real-time result visibility via smart contract reads.

---

## üë• Target Users
- **Voters**: Students eligible to vote using MetaMask.
- **Admins**: Election officials who manage users, elections, and candidate data.

## üîê Authentication Flow

### Voter Registration
- User registers via frontend and is saved in Django.
- Admin verifies and whitelists voter by updating the contract.

### Login
- User logs in with **MetaMask** wallet.
- Off-chain authentication (student ID) links to MetaMask address.
